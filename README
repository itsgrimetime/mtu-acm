    ~ What is this?

      A simple SQLite and Flask powered registration website
      for TechHacks registration. 

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the mtu_acm.py file or
         export an MTU_ACM_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. fire up a python shell and run this:

         >>> from mtu_acm import init_db; init_db()

      3. now you can run the mtu_acm.py file with your
         python interpreter and the application will
         greet you on http://localhost:5000/

    ~ Are there tests?

      Oh you betcha.  Run the `mtu_acm_tests.py` file to
      see the tests pass. Add more if you dare.
